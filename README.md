# integral_lattice
To find the generators of the dual lattice of an integral lattice

This Python program provides a class named integral_lattice, which should take an positive integral symmetric lattice such as the intersection form of a positive quadractic integral form.

This class provides some basic invariants of the lattice such as the rank (or dimension), the discriminant of the lattice,
and more complicated invariants such as the whole list of the dual lattice and the generators of the dual lattice.

Rewriten in C++ which makes it much faster.
